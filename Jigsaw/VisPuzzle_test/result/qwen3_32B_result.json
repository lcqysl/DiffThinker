Since the image is presented as a jigsaw puzzle with two blocks, and they are arranged vertically, the correct order is simply top to bottom: block 1 followed by block 2.\n\nSolution: 1 2",

The top section (labeled 1) shows the upper part of the scene: a red wall on the left, a wooden cabinet above, and two black trash bins labeled \"TRASH\" and \"RECYCLE\" on the right. The bottom section (labeled 2) shows the lower part of the same scene: the base of the red wall, the floor, and the lower halves of the same trash bins.\n\nSince the image is a jigsaw puzzle with two blocks, and they are vertically stacked, the correct order is to place the top block (1) above the bottom block (2).

The suitcase is open and resting on a carpeted floor.\n\nThe original image must be reconstructed by placing the top half (block 1) above the bottom half (block 2). Since the image is split horizontally, and the blocks are labeled 1 (top) and 2 (bottom), the correct order when reading left to right, top to bottom, is simply 1 followed by 2.\n\nSolution: 1 2",

The bottom image, labeled \"2\", shows the full facade of the APA Hotel, which is the same building seen in the top image.\n\nSince the top image is a wider street view and the bottom image is a zoomed-in view of the same building, the logical order is to place the street view (image 1) first, followed by the close-up of the hotel (image 2). However, since the puzzle is presented as two separate blocks (top and bottom), and we are to restore the original image by arranging the blocks in the correct order, we must consider that the original image likely had the street view on top and the hotel close-up on the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: 1 (top) then 2 (bottom).\n\nSolution: 1 2",

    "00286_problem.jpg": "The image is a jigsaw puzzle composed of three horizontal strips, each labeled with a number (1, 2, 3) in the top-left corner. The goal is to arrange these strips in the correct vertical order to reconstruct the original image.\n\nLet’s analyze the content of each strip:\n\n- **Strip 1 (top)**: Shows the upper part of a city street with tall buildings, a FedEx truck, and a sign for \"FedEx Kinko's Ship Center\". The sky is visible between the buildings, and the perspective is looking down the street. This appears to be the top portion of the image.\n\n- **Strip 2 (middle)**: Shows a view looking straight down the street between tall buildings, with the sky very bright and overexposed. There are no vehicles or people visible, just the buildings and the sky. This is clearly the middle section of the image, continuing the perspective from Strip 1.\n\n- **Strip 3 (bottom)**: Shows the street level with a black car parked, a sidewalk with a person and some belongings, a fire hydrant, and a white delivery truck. This is the bottom portion of the image.\n\nThe logical order is from top to bottom: Strip 1 (top view), then Strip 2 (middle view), then Strip 3 (bottom view).\n\nTherefore, the correct order is 1, 2, 3.\n\nSolution: 1 2 3",

The goal is to arrange these strips in the correct vertical order to reconstruct the original bathroom scene.\n\nLet’s analyze the content of each strip:\n\n- **Strip 1 (top)**: Shows the top part of the bathroom, including the shower curtain with purple flower patterns, the top of the mirror, and a reflection of a closet or cabinet. The mirror reflects a door and part of a room beyond.\n\n- **Strip 2 (middle)**: Shows the middle section, including the sink with a chrome faucet, a soap dispenser, an electrical outlet, and the lower part of the mirror. The shower curtain is still visible on the left.\n\n- **Strip 3 (bottom)**: Shows the bottom part of the bathroom, including the lower part of the sink, the vanity cabinet with white handles, and a red bath mat on the floor. The shower curtain is visible at the bottom edge.\n\nThe logical vertical order of the bathroom scene is:\n\n1. Top: Strip 1 (shower curtain top, mirror top, reflection)\n2. Middle: Strip 2 (sink, faucet, outlet, mirror middle)\n3. Bottom: Strip 3 (sink base, cabinet, bath mat)\n\nThus, the correct order from top to bottom is 1, 2, 3.\n\nSolution: 1 2 3",

    "00312_problem.jpg": "The image is divided into three horizontal sections, each labeled with a number: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n- Block 1 shows the top part of a robot, specifically its base or lower body, on a dark carpeted floor.\n- Block 2 shows the middle section of the robot, including its torso and head, with a background of glass walls and a door.\n- Block 3 shows the lower part of the robot, including its arm extended outward, with the same background as block 2.\n\nTo reconstruct the original image, we need to arrange these blocks in vertical order from top to bottom. The robot’s body should be continuous: the base (block 1) at the bottom, the torso (block 2) in the middle, and the arm (block 3) at the bottom — but wait, that doesn’t make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the robot’s structure:\n\n- Block 1 is the base (lowest part).\n- Block 2 is the torso/head (middle part).\n- Block 3 is the arm and lower torso (which should be below the head/torso).\n\nBut in the image, block 3 shows the arm extended, which is likely the lower part of the robot, so it should be at the bottom. Block 2 is the middle section (torso/head), and block 1 is the base — which is the very bottom.\n\nWait — this is confusing. Let’s think again.\n\nActually, the robot is shown from bottom to top in the image. The correct vertical order should be:\n\n- Bottom: block 1 (base)\n- Middle: block 2 (torso/head)\n- Top: block 3 (arm — but this doesn’t make sense because the arm is part of the lower body)\n\nWait — no. Looking at the image again:\n\nBlock 3 shows the robot’s arm extended, which is part of the lower body. Block 2 shows the torso and head. Block 1 shows the base.\n\nSo the correct vertical order from top to bottom should be:\n\n- Top: block 2 (head/torso)\n- Middle: block 3 (arm — but this is below the torso, so it should be below block 2)\n- Bottom: block 1 (base — but this is the very bottom)\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nWait — perhaps the blocks are arranged vertically in the image as they appear, and we need to reorder them to form a continuous robot.\n\nLooking at the robot’s structure:\n\n- The base is at the bottom (block 1).\n- The torso is above the base (block 2).\n- The arm is attached to the torso (block 3).\n\nBut in the image, block 3 is shown below block 2, which is correct — the arm is below the torso.\n\nBut block 1 is shown above block 2 — that’s wrong.\n\nSo the correct order from top to bottom should be:\n\n- Top: block 2 (torso/head)\n- Middle: block 3 (arm)\n- Bottom: block 1 (base)\n\nBut that doesn’t make sense — the base should be at the bottom.\n\nWait — perhaps the blocks are not in the correct vertical order. The puzzle is to rearrange them so that the robot appears continuous.\n\nLooking at the content:\n\n- Block 1: robot base on floor — this should be the bottom.\n- Block 2: robot torso/head — this should be above the base.\n- Block 3: robot arm — this should be attached to the torso, so it should be below the torso? But arms are usually attached to the torso, so block 3 should be below block 2.\n\nBut in the image, block 3 is shown below block 2 — which is correct for the robot’s structure.\n\nBut block 1 is shown above block 2 — which is wrong.\n\nSo the correct vertical order should be:\n\n- Bottom: block 1\n- Middle: block 2\n- Top: block 3\n\nBut that would put the arm at the top, which is not correct.\n\nWait — perhaps the blocks are arranged from top to bottom in the image as 1, 2, 3, but we need to reorder them.\n\nThe original image is a vertical stack of three blocks. The correct order should be:\n\n- Top: block 2 (head/torso)\n- Middle: block 3 (arm)\n- Bottom: block 1 (base)\n\nBut that would mean the robot’s head is at the top, arm in the middle, base at the bottom — which is correct.\n\nBut block 3 shows the arm, which is attached to the torso — so it should be below the torso (block 2). So block 2 should be above block 3.\n\nAnd block 1 is the base — so it should be below block 3.\n\nSo the correct order from top to bottom is: block 2, then block 3, then block 1.\n\nBut that would mean the robot’s head is at the top, arm in the middle, base at the bottom — which is anatomically correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the correct order is: 2, 3, 1.\n\nSolution: 2 3 1",
