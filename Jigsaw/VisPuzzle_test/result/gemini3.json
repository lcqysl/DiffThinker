A pulpit is visible on the right side.\n    *   When **Part 2 is placed on the left** and **Part 1 is placed on the right** (the 2-1 arrangement), the pews from both sides face inward toward a central aisle. This creates a standard, symmetrical church layout.\n\n2.  **Focal Points:**\n    *   In the 2-1 arrangement, the pulpit (from Part 2) and the altar (from Part 1) meet in the center of the image. This puts the most important religious elements of the church at the focal point of the photograph.\n    *   The painted arches on the ceiling in the top-right of Part 2 and the top-left of Part 1 appear to complement each other, forming a cohesive architectural structure over the central altar area.\n\n3.  **Symmetry:**\n    *   The windows and chandeliers would be positioned on the far left (from Part 2) and far right (from Part 1), creating a balanced and natural-looking wide-angle view of the church interior.\n\nIn contrast, placing Part 1 on the left and Part 2 on the right (1-2) would result in the altar and pulpit being on the far outer edges of the image and the windows being shoved into the center, which is not a standard way to photograph or view a church interior.\n\nTherefore, Part 1 should be to the right of Part 2.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the right of Part 2",

The right edge of Part 1 shows the middle section of the table and the floor.\n2.  **Analyze Part 2**: This part shows the right side of the room. It features the right half of the table with various objects (like a bowl, a knife, and a salt shaker). There is a chair in the foreground on the right side of the table. In the background, there is a large double door on the back wall. The left edge of Part 2 shows the middle section of the table and the floor.\n3.  **Connecting the Parts**: By placing Part 1 on the left and Part 2 on the right, the table is reconstructed as a single, continuous piece of furniture in the center of the room. The floor and the perspective of the walls also align perfectly. The objects on the table and the chairs surrounding it are positioned logically in this 1-2 arrangement.\n\nIf we were to place Part 2 on the left and Part 1 on the right, the table would be split, with its left half on the far right and its right half on the far left, which would not form a natural-looking image.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 2 should be to the right of Part 1",

In Part 2, the left edge of the cloth shows the right half of the same circular design. When Part 1 is placed to the left of Part 2, these halves form a complete, centered pattern.\n2.  **\"IHS\" Symbol:** On the dark wooden paneling just above the altar cloth, there is a traditional \"IHS\" monogram. Part 1 contains the \"I\" and the left side of the \"H,\" while Part 2 contains the right side of the \"H\" and the \"S.\" Placing Part 1 on the left and Part 2 on the right reconstructs this symbol correctly.\n3.  **Red Carpet and Brass Rail:** The red carpeted steps and the brass rail in the foreground are continuous. In Part 1, the carpet and rail extend to the right edge, and in Part 2, they extend to the left edge. Joining them in the order 1-2 creates a single, continuous altar step and rail.\n4.  **Commemorative Stones:** At the bottom of the image, there are two stones (or cushions). Part 1 (on the left) has a stone that says \"SILVER,\" and Part 2 (on the right) has a stone that says \"JUBILEE.\" Together, from left to right, they read \"SILVER JUBILEE,\" which is a common commemorative phrase.\n5.  **Symmetry:** The overall scene is symmetrical. Part 1 has a tall candlestick, a vase of flowers, and a triple candlestick on the left side of the altar. Part 2 has the same elements in reverse order on the right side. The far left of the image (Part 1) features a stand of white flowers, while the far right (Part 2) features a church banner. This arrangement is typical for a church altar.\n\nBased on these observations, Part 1 is the left side and Part 2 is the right side of the image.

At the right edge of Part 1, this structure reaches a certain height and features a horizontal top rail. In Part 2, a similar white metal truss structure begins at the left edge at the same height, with a matching horizontal top rail, and then slopes downward toward the bottom right. The alignment of the horizontal rails and diagonal members at the joint suggests that Part 1 belongs on the left and Part 2 on the right.\n\n2.  **Middle-ground Boat:** At the right edge of Part 1, there is a dark boat with yellow/orange markings. At the left edge of Part 2, the other half of this same dark boat is visible, also featuring the same yellow/orange markings.

In Part 2, a yellow line starts near the bottom left corner and continues toward the right. If Part 1 is placed to the left of Part 2, these two segments form a single, continuous diagonal line across the floor.\n2.  **Background Elements**: The shelves and boxes in the background of both images appear to be part of the same warehouse environment. The height and perspective of the shelving units align better when Part 1 is on the left and Part 2 is on the right.\n3.  **Overall Composition**: Placing Part 1 on the left and Part 2 on the right creates a natural-looking scene of a warehouse aisle with various pieces of equipment (a green machine and a white stove in Part 1, and a larger metal machine on a pallet in Part 2) arranged along a walkway marked by the yellow line.\n\nIf the parts were reversed (Part 1 to the right of Part 2), the yellow line would be disconnected, jumping from the bottom of the frame on the left to much higher up on the right, which would not be natural.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the left of Part 2",

On the left, there's a black-and-white patterned bed with a Marilyn Monroe poster above it. To the right of the bed is a white wall decorated with circular items (a green button, a white plate, and a patterned plate). Further right, there are curtains—one white with grey polka dots and one solid black. A polka-dot rug is on the floor.\n2.  **Analyze Part 2:** This image shows a wider view of the same store.

On the right edge of this part, we see a Marilyn Monroe poster and a black headboard, which match the elements on the left side of Part 1.\n3.  **Find the Connection:** The key connection is the Marilyn Monroe poster and the black headboard. In Part 2, these elements are on the right edge. In Part 1, they are on the left edge. However, a closer look at the posters reveals they are two separate displays of the same poster or the same display seen from different perspectives. \n4.  **Determine the Order:** Looking at the overall scene, Part 2 provides the \"outside\" view (the store aisle) on its left side, while Part 1 provides the \"inside\" corner of the room setting on its right side (the curtains and decorated wall). In IKEA showrooms, room settings are often arranged along an aisle. Placing Part 2 to the left of Part 1 creates a natural flow: from the store aisle (left of Part 2) into a decorated room setting (right of Part 2 and all of Part 1).\n\nBy placing Part 2 to the left of Part 1, the image shows the transition from the store's open floor into a specific bedroom display.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 2 should be to the left of Part 1",

The pillar and the window rows appear to slant toward the top-left, indicating a perspective looking up at the building's right edge.\n2.  **Part 2:** This image shows the opposite side. There is a thick brown structural pillar on the left, with dark sky further to the left. To the right of the pillar are rows of windows. The pillar and the window rows slant toward the top-right, indicating a perspective looking up at the building's left edge.\n\n**Synthesis:**\n- If we place **Part 2 to the left of Part 1**, we create a cohesive image of a single building facade. On the far left, we have sky, then a pillar, then a central section of windows (where the right side of Part 2 meets the left side of Part 1), then another pillar, and finally sky on the far right. The slants of both parts converge toward the top center, which is the natural perspective for a tall building viewed from below.\n- If we place Part 1 to the left of Part 2, we would have windows on the outside edges and a double-pillar in the center with sky in the middle of the image, which does not form a continuous, natural-looking structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct arrangement is to have Part 2 on the left and Part 1 on the right.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 2 should be to the left of Part 1",

The rear of a black SUV is also visible at the bottom right. On the left side of Part 2, there is a tree and the front half of a light blue car.\n3.  **Examine Part 1:** This part shows a row of parked cars and a silver car in the foreground. On its far-left edge, we can see a vertical, pointed structure, which is the steeple of the upside-down church sculpture. On its right edge, there are some green and yellow recycling bins.\n4.  **Find the connection:** The sculpture is a single continuous piece. In the sculpture, the steeple is attached to the main body of the church. \n    - If we place **Part 2 to the left of Part 1**, the right edge of Part 2 (showing the main body of the church) would need to connect to the left edge of Part 1 (showing the steeple). However, in this sculpture, the steeple is at one end and the body extends from it. \n    - Looking more closely at the sculpture's orientation in the image, the body of the church in Part 2 is tilted with its roof pointing upwards and to the right. The steeple is the part that touches the ground. In Part 1, the steeple is on the far left. \n    - If we place **Part 1 to the right of Part 2**, the right edge of Part 2 (where the body of the church is) would meet the left edge of Part 1 (where the steeple is). This would mean the steeple is on the right of the body, which matches the orientation seen in the image.\n    - More importantly, look at the cars and trees. In Part 1, there are branches of a pine tree at the top right. In Part 2, there are similar pine tree branches at the top left. This suggests that Part 1 should be to the left of Part 2.\n    - Let's re-examine the [1, 2] arrangement: The right edge of Part 1 has green bins and a palm tree. The left edge of Part 2 has a tree and the front of a light blue car. This forms a continuous street scene. The pine tree branches at the top of both parts would also align.\n    - In the [1, 2] arrangement, the steeple (Part 1, left) and the body (Part 2, right) are both visible in their respective positions in the wider scene.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 2 should be to the right of Part 1",

To the right of the cabinet, there is a corner leading to another wall with a window and a sliver of another door.\n3.  By placing **Part 1 on the left** and **Part 2 on the right**, the central wall becomes continuous, featuring both the picture frame (from Part 1) and the cabinet (from Part 2).

A small sliver of the tower is visible behind and to the left of the hub.\n2.  **Part 2:** Shows the main body of the tower and the cap. On the cap, there is a fan-tail (a small windmill-like structure used to turn the main sails into the wind) on the left side. On the right side of Part 2, there are two sails: one pointing up-right and another pointing down-right.\n\n**Analyzing the Arrangement:**\n-   **If Part 1 is to the left of Part 2 (1-2):** The hub would be on the far left of the image. The cap and tower (from Part 2) would be to the right of the hub. This would mean we are viewing the windmill from the side, with the sails at the \"front\" (left) and the tower behind them. In this configuration, the sails in Part 2 (which point up-right and down-right) would be the outer parts of the sails that are attached to the hub in Part 1.

This would place the hub on the \"front\" of the windmill if we were looking at it from the other side. However, the fan-tail in Part 2 is on the left of the cap, and the hub is usually on the opposite side. More importantly, the sails in Part 2 are on its right edge. If Part 1 is to the right of Part 2, these sails would connect to the hub in Part 1.\n\n**Refining the Connection:**\nLooking closely at the sails and the tower:\n-   In Part 1, the hub is on the left and the tower is behind it.\n-   In Part 2, the tower is the main body, and the cap is on top.\n-   The sail in Part 1 that points down-right ends at the right edge of Part 1. If we place Part 2 to its right, that sail continues perfectly towards the sail visible in the middle-right of Part 2.\n-   The sky and the hedge at the bottom also align more naturally when Part 1 is on the left and Part 2 is on the right.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the left of Part 2",

At the bottom left, there is a section of a black granite countertop with a distinct silver/white trim along its edge.\n2.  **Part 2 (right):** This part features a bathroom sink set into a black granite countertop. On the right side of this part, there is a large mirror. The black countertop also features a silver/white trim along its edge.\n\n**Connecting the parts:**\n*   **Countertop Alignment:** If we place Part 2 to the left and Part 1 to the right, the black countertop from the right side of Part 2 seamlessly continues into the left side of Part 1. The silver/white trim line at the bottom of the countertop also aligns perfectly across the two parts.\n*   **Mirror Reflection:** The large mirror in Part 2 reflects the magnifying mirror and the tissue box holder, which are located in Part 1. This confirms that these items are positioned across from or adjacent to the sink area shown in Part 2.\n*   **Wall and Layout:** Placing Part 2 on the left and Part 1 on the right creates a natural-looking bathroom corner or continuous wall layout where the sink is the central feature and the amenities (hairdryer, phone, extra mirror) are located to its side.\n\nTherefore, Part 1 should be placed to the right of Part 2 to reconstruct the original image correctly.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the right of Part 2",
    "00024_problem.jpg": "To reconstruct the image, we need to find the correct sequence of the two parts.\n\n1.  **Analyze Part 1:** This part shows the head of a bed with a dark brown headboard on the left, a nightstand with a lamp to its right, and two floating shelves on a teal patterned wall. A company logo (\"temahome\") is located in the bottom right corner of this part.\n2.  **Analyze Part 2:** This part shows a white door on the left, a dark brown dresser next to it, and the foot of a bed on the far right. There is a patterned rug on the floor in front of the bed.\n3.  **Find the connection:** \n    *   If we place **Part 1 to the left of Part 2**, the sequence would be: Head of bed $\\rightarrow$ Nightstand $\\rightarrow$ Door $\\rightarrow$ Dresser $\\rightarrow$ Foot of bed. This forms a wide, natural-looking view of a bedroom where the bed is split across the far ends of the image, which is unlikely for a standard photograph.\n    *   If we place **Part 1 to the right of Part 2**, the sequence would be: Door $\\rightarrow$ Dresser $\\rightarrow$ Foot of bed $\\rightarrow$ Head of bed $\\rightarrow$ Nightstand. This also doesn't make sense as the foot and head of the bed would be adjacent.\n4.  **Re-evaluating the edges:**\n    *   Look at the right edge of Part 2: It shows the foot of the bed.\n    *   Look at the left edge of Part 1: It shows the head of the bed.\n    *   Look at the logo: It's in the bottom right of Part 1. In professional photography, logos are almost always placed in the bottom right corner of the *entire* image. This strongly suggests Part 1 is the right half.\n    *   Looking at the room layout again: If Part 2 is on the left and Part 1 is on the right, we see a door, a dresser, and then a corner of the room. The bed is positioned such that its foot is in Part 2 and its head is in Part 1. Wait, if Part 2 is on the left, its right edge (foot of bed) would meet the left edge of Part 1 (head of bed). This is only possible if the bed is facing \"out\" of the image or if they are two different parts of the room.\n    *   Actually, looking at the wallpaper and the overall composition, Part 1 clearly belongs on the left because the bed's headboard is typically a starting point on one side of a room's main wall, and the \"temahome\" logo, while often in the corner, is positioned here at the end of the first logical section.\n    *   Wait, let's look at the \"white strip\" mentioned. The image is a 1x2 puzzle.\n    *   Let's re-examine the connection between the right of Part 1 and the left of Part 2. Part 1 ends with a plain teal wall and floor. Part 2 begins with a white door frame. This is a very common and natural transition in a room (wall ends at a door). \n    *   Furthermore, the logo in Part 1 being in the bottom right of the *first* part would place it in the center of the combined image, which is less common than being at the far right. However, looking at the visual flow, Bed $\\rightarrow$ Nightstand $\\rightarrow$ Door $\\rightarrow$ Dresser $\\rightarrow$ Foot of bed is a much more coherent scene than any other combination.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the left of Part 2",

Placing Part 1 to the left of Part 2 aligns these two parts, showing two cars parked nose-to-tail.\n2.  **Silver Car Continuity**: In Part 1, there is a silver car on the left. At the bottom-right corner of Part 1, there is a small sliver of the front of another silver car. In Part 2, a silver car is prominently featured in the middle. Placing Part 1 to the left of Part 2 suggests that the sliver in Part 1 is the beginning of the silver car seen in Part 2.\n3.  **Background and Architecture**: Part 1 shows a storefront labeled \"AC...DO PARA EL COMERCIO\" on its right side. Part 2 shows a walkway area on its left side. In a typical street scene, a storefront would be adjacent to such a walkway. The roofline and the overall architectural style (columns, tiled roof) are consistent across both parts when placed in this order.\n4.  **Alternative Check**: If Part 2 were placed to the left of Part 1, the right edge of Part 2 (a column and a window) would not naturally transition into the left edge of Part 1 (a silver car and a wall with an air conditioner).\n\nTherefore, the correct arrangement is to have Part 1 on the left and Part 2 on the right.\n\nFinal Answer: Part 1 should be to the left of Part 2",

    "00185_problem.jpg": "To determine the correct arrangement of the three parts, let's examine the visual connections between them:\n\n1.  **Part 1 and Part 2**: The right edge of Part 1 shows the beginning (left side) of a white pavilion structure on a pier. The left edge of Part 2 shows the continuation (right side) of that same pavilion. The snowy shoreline also transitions naturally from the bottom of Part 1 into the middle of Part 2.\n2.  **Part 2 and Part 3**: The right edge of Part 2 shows the horizontal structure of the pier extending into the water. The left edge of Part 3 shows the continuation and eventual end of that same pier structure. The sea and the sky also maintain a consistent horizon line and cloud pattern across these parts.\n\nLooking at the image as it is currently presented (from left to right: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), the elements (the snowy bushes, the shoreline, the pavilion, the pier, and the sea) already form a continuous and natural scene.\n\n-   **Left Part**: Part 1 (contains the land and the start of the pier)\n-   **Middle Part**: Part 2 (contains the middle of the pier and the curving shoreline)\n-   **Right Part**: Part 3 (contains the end of the pier and the open sea)\n\nThis confirms that the current order (1-2-3) is the correct reconstruction of the original image.\n\nFinal Answer: The left part should be Part 1; the middle part should be Part 2; and the right part should be Part 3.",
    "00186_problem.jpg": "To reconstruct the natural image, we need to analyze the three parts and find where their edges and contents align.\n\n1.  **Analyze the contents:**\n    *   **Part 1:** Shows a large, multi-tiered bookshelf filled with books. The perspective shows the shelves receding into the distance toward the right (the horizontal lines of the shelves slant downwards from left to right, and the vertical supports get closer together).\n    *   **Part 2:** Shows a man in a library aisle. He is facing right, reaching toward a bookshelf. To his left is a window, and on his far left, there is a dark vertical structure. The bookshelf on his right has the same design and perspective as the one in Part 1 (slanted downwards to the right).\n    *   **Part 3:** Shows a stack of glass-fronted barrister bookcases.\n\n2.  **Find the connections:**\n    *   **Connecting Part 2 and Part 1:** The bookshelf on the right of Part 2 appears to be the same unit as the one shown in Part 1. Given the perspective (the shelves slant down toward the right), the part of the shelf in Part 2 is closer to the camera than the part in Part 1. Therefore, Part 2 should be to the left of Part 1.\n    *   **Connecting Part 3 and Part 2:** Now we need to place Part 3. Part 2 shows a window to the man's left and a dark vertical edge at the very left of the frame. Part 3 shows the front of a set of cabinets. If we place Part 3 to the left of Part 2, the right edge of the cabinets in Part 3 aligns with the dark vertical structure on the left of Part 2. This creates a logical room layout: a wall with glass cabinets (Part 3), followed by a window and an aisle where a man is working (Part 2), and a long bookshelf continuing to the right (Part 1).\n\n3.  **Verify the sequence 3-2-1:**\n    *   **Left (Part 3):** Glass-fronted cabinets.\n    *   **Middle (Part 2):** Window, man, and the beginning of a long bookshelf.\n    *   **Right (Part 1):** The continuation of the long bookshelf.\n    *   This arrangement forms a continuous, natural scene of a library. The perspective of the bookshelves in Parts 2 and 1 is consistent, and the transition from the cabinets in Part 3 to the window in Part 2 is a plausible architectural layout.\n\nFinal Answer: The left part should be Part 3; the middle part should be Part 2; and the right part should be Part 1.",
    "00187_problem.jpg": "Based on the visual evidence in the images:\n\n1.  **Analyze the parts:**\n    *   **Part 1:** Shows a door partially open, swinging into the room. To the left of the door, there's a glimpse into another room with blue walls. A wooden door frame is visible at the top.\n    *   **Part 2:** Shows a large television on a white stand against a dark gray wall. The floor is reddish-brown wood.\n    *   **Part 3:** Shows a picture of a cave/arch on the same dark gray wall. On the right side of this part, there is a light-colored wooden door frame and a tiny sliver of a blue room.\n\n2.  **Connect the pieces:**\n    *   **Connecting Part 3 and Part 1:** The right edge of Part 3 features a door frame and a sliver of a blue room. The left edge of Part 1 shows the continuation of that blue room opening. This indicates that Part 3 must be placed to the left of Part 1.\n    *   **Connecting Part 2 and Part 3:** Both parts feature the same dark gray wall and reddish-brown wooden floor. Part 2 shows the TV, and Part 3 shows the picture. Placing Part 2 to the left of Part 3 creates a continuous wall featuring first the TV and then the picture, which is a natural room arrangement.\n    *   **Ceiling Trim:** All three parts have a consistent wooden trim at the top, which further confirms they are part of the same wall/room.\n\n3.  **Determine the order:**\n    *   The most logical sequence that connects all the elements (wall, floor, door frame, and blue room) is **Part 2 - Part 3 - Part 1**.\n    *   **Part 2 (Left):** TV on the dark gray wall.\n    *   **Part 3 (Middle):** Picture on the dark gray wall, followed by the start of a doorway.\n    *   **Part 1 (Right):** The rest of the doorway with the door swinging open.\n\nFinal Answer: The left part should be Part 2; the middle part should be Part 3; and the right part should be Part 1.",

The tiling and the cabinet match perfectly with the right edge of Part 1.\n3.  **Part 3 (Right):** Shows a wooden shelving unit. The perspective and the sliver of blue floor at the bottom left indicate this unit is on the right wall of the room, continuing from the scene in Part 2.\n\n**Reconstruction Analysis:**\n*   **Cabinet and Wall:** The black cabinet and the horizontal grout lines of the tiled wall align perfectly between Part 1 and Part 2. This confirms that Part 1 is to the immediate left of Part 2.\n*   **Perspective:** The overall perspective of the room flows naturally from left to right in the 1-2-3 sequence. We see the left wall (door in Part 1), the back wall (cabinet and doorway in Parts 1 and 2), and finally the right wall (shelving unit in Part 3).\n*   **Logical Layout:** A room layout with a door, then furniture (cabinet), then an opening to another room (doorway), and finally more furniture (shelves) is highly consistent and natural.\n\nComparing this to the provided options, the correct arrangement is 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.\n\nFinal Answer: The left part should be Part 1; the middle part should be Part 2; and the right part should be Part 3.",

Additionally, the black seating at the bottom of Part 2 aligns with the seating in Part 1.\n    *   **Part 1 and Part 3:** The right edge of Part 1 features a magazine rack that continues onto the left edge of Part 3. The wooden beam at the top also aligns across these two parts.\n2.  **Determine the sequence:**\n    *   Part 2 must be on the left because it contains the corner of the room's wooden beam structure and its right side matches the left side of Part 1.\n    *   Part 1 must be in the middle as it connects the bookshelf area (from Part 2) to the magazine rack area (leading to Part 3).\n    *   Part 3 must be on the right as it continues the magazine rack and shows the desk area with the \"Career\" sign.\n\nThe correct arrangement is **Part 2, Part 1, Part 3**.\n\nFinal Answer: The left part should be Part 2; the middle part should be Part 1; and the right part should be Part 3.",

There is a plain wall on the left side of these steps.\n    *   **Part 3 (top-left in the current grid):** Shows an upper wall area with several framed pictures.\n    *   **Part 4 (bottom-left in the current grid):** Shows a wrought iron railing and the curved, light-colored underside of a staircase. There is a wall in the background.\n\n2.  **Look for horizontal connections:**\n    *   **Part 2 and Part 1:** Part 2 has steps on its right side, and Part 1 has steps on its left side. When placed side-by-side ([Part 2][Part 1]), they form a single, continuous wide staircase. The wall on the left of Part 2 and the pillar/plant on the right of Part 1 would then frame this wide staircase.\n    *   **Part 3 and Part 4:** Part 3 is a wall with pictures. Part 4 has a wall in the background behind the railing and curved structure. These can plausibly fit together as the upper-left and upper-right sections of the scene.\n\n3.  **Look for vertical connections:**\n    *   **Part 3 and Part 2:** If Part 3 is above Part 2, the wall with pictures is located above the wall and the left side of the stairs.

In 4, it's at the top.\n                    *   In 3, it's roughly in the middle-right.\n                    *   In 4, it's roughly in the middle-left.\n                    *   Wait, if we put 3 to the left of 1, and 4 to the left of 2...\n                    *   3 1\n                    *   4 2\n                    *   The blue chair in 3 (bottom-right) would be next to the yellow chair arm in 1 (bottom-left).\n                    *   The blue chair in 4 (top-left) would be below... something in 3.\n                    *   This is confusing. Let's look at the options and pick the most plausible one.\n                    *   Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n                    *   Let's look at the image again.\n                    *   If 3 is TL, 1 is TR, 4 is BL, 2 is BR:\n                        *   3 (top-left)\n                        *   1 (top-right)\n                        *   4 (bottom-left)\n                        *   2 (bottom-right)\n                        *   Wait, in 3, the blue chair is on the right. In 4, the blue chair is on the left.\n                        *   If 3 is above 4, this doesn't match.\n                        *   BUT, if 1 is above 4? No.\n                        *   What if 3 is top-right and 4 is bottom-left?\n                        *   Then 3-bottom-left would match 4-top-right.\n                        *   Let's look: 3-bottom-left is a white pillar. 4-top-right is a yellow chair. No.\n                        *   Let's try another combination.\n                        *   What if 1 is top-left and 2 is bottom-right?\n                        *   What if 1 is top-left, 4 is top-right, 3 is bottom-left, 2 is bottom-right?\n                        *   1 (TL): window, patterned chair (bottom-right).\n                        *   4 (TR): blue chair (top-left), yellow chair (right).\n                        *   3 (BL): window, pillar, blue chair (bottom-right).\n                        *   2 (BR): yellow chair (left), patterned chair (top-right).\n                        *   Let's check matches:\n                            *   1 (TL) and 4 (TR): 1-right window to 4-left blue chair. (No)\n                            *   1 (TL) and 3 (BL): 1-bottom patterned chair to 3-top window. (No)\n                            *   4 (TR) and 2 (BR): 4-bottom yellow chair to 2-top yellow chair. (YES! The yellow chair in 4 is at the bottom right, and in 2 it's at the top left. Wait, let me look.)\n                            *   In 4, the yellow chair is on the right. In 2, it's on the left. If 4 is above 2, the top and bottom would have to match.\n                            *   In 4, we see the side of the chair. In 2, we see the back. This could be a vertical match!\n                            *   If 4 is above 2, then the yellow chair in 4 (bottom) matches the yellow chair in 2 (top).\n                            *   And if 3 is above 1? 3-bottom blue chair, 1-top window.

(No)\n                            *   Wait, let's look at the options again. There are only four. One of them *must* be right.\n                            *   Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n                            *   Option 2: TL=4, TR=2, BL=3, BR=1.\n                            *   Option 3: TL=1, TR=4, BL=3, BR=2.\n                            *   Option 4: TL=2, TR=3, BL=1, BR=4.\n                            *   Let's re-test Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n                                *   3-1 (horizontal): Window matches.\n                                *   4-2 (horizontal): Yellow chair and table match.\n                                *   3-4 (vertical): Blue chair matches?\n                                    *   In 3, blue chair is bottom-right.\n                                    *   In 4, blue chair is top-left.\n                                    *   Wait, if 3 is top-left and 4 is bottom-left, the blue chair is in the bottom-right of the top piece and the top-left of the bottom piece. That's a vertical misalignment.\n                                    *   UNLESS... the blue chair is actually two different chairs?\n                                    *   Or unless 3 and 1 are not the top row?\n                                    *   But 3 and 1 have the windows!\n                                    *   Wait, let me look at the blue chair in 3 and 4 *very* closely.\n                                    *   In 3, it's a blue patterned chair? No, it looks solid.\n                                    *   In 4, it's a solid blue chair.\n                                    *   Wait! In 1, it's a patterned blue chair.\n                                    *   In 2, there's a patterned blue chair in the background.\n                                    *   Could 1 be above 2?\n                                    *   If 1 is TL and 2 is BL:\n                                        *   1-bottom-right is patterned chair.\n                                        *   2-top-right is patterned chair.\n                                        *   This matches!\n                                    *   Then what are TR and BR? 3 and 4?\n                                        *   If TR=3 and BR=4:\n                                            *   3-bottom-right is solid blue chair.\n                                            *   4-top-right is... yellow chair.

The solid blue chair is on the right.\n                                            *   So it would be in 3-bottom-right.\n                                            *   And in 4, it's in 4-top-left.\n                                            *   Still not matching.\n\n9.  **Let me try one more time. Let's look at the whole picture.**\n    *   It's a room with a large window.\n    *   There's a solid blue chair, a patterned blue chair, and a yellow chair.\n    *   Let's re-examine the pieces.\n    *   1: Window, plant, patterned chair.\n    *   2: Yellow chair, patterned chair in background.\n    *   3: Window, pillar, solid blue chair.\n    *   4: Solid blue chair, table, yellow chair.\n    *   Let's look at the yellow chair. It's in 4 and 2.\n        *   In 4, it's on the right. In 2, it's on the left.\n        *   So 4 is to the left of 2. (4-2)\n    *   Now, what is above 4 and 2?\n        *   Above 4: 4 has a solid blue chair on the left. 3 has a solid blue chair on the right.\n        *   Wait, if 3 is to the left of some piece, then its right side would be the middle.\n        *   If 4 is to the right of some piece, then its left side would be the middle.\n        *   So, if 3 is top-left and 4 is top-right? No, 4 has no window.\n        *   Let's try: 3 is top-left, 1 is top-right.\n            *   3-right has a window. 1-left has a window. They match.\n            *   3-bottom-right has a solid blue chair.\n            *   1-bottom-left has a yellow chair arm.\n        *   Now, what's below them?\n            *   Below 3 (TL) is 4 (BL)?\n                *   3-bottom-right (blue chair) -> 4-top-right (yellow chair). (No)\n            *   Below 3 (TL) is 2 (BL)?\n                *   3-bottom-right (blue chair) -> 2-top-right (patterned chair). (No)\n            *   Wait! Let's try Option 1 again and look *really* closely at the image.\n            *   Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n            *   Maybe the chair in 3 is NOT the chair in 4.\n            *   Look at Part 3: There's a white pillar. To the right of the pillar is a window, and below that window is a blue chair.\n            *   Look at Part 1: To the right of that window is another window pane, and below it is a plant and a patterned chair.\n            *   Look at Part 4: Below the blue chair in 3 should be the rest of it.\n            *   Is the blue chair in 4 below the blue chair in 3?\n            *   In 3, the chair is on the right side of the piece.\n            *   In 4, the chair is on the left side of the piece.\n            *   IF 3 IS TOP-LEFT AND 4 IS BOTTOM-LEFT, the chair in 3 (right) and the chair in 4 (left) do not align.\n            *   WAIT! What if the pieces are not TL, TR, BL, BR but something else? No, the prompt says 2x2.\n            *   Let me re-read: \"1\" (top-left), \"2\" (top-right), \"3\" (bottom-left), and \"4\" (bottom-right).\n            *   Okay, the labels ARE the current positions.\n            *   Current TL = 1, TR = 2, BL = 3, BR = 4.\n            *   I need to find the correct order.\n            *   Let's re-test Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n                *   TL (3) | TR (1)\n                *   BL (4) | BR (2)\n                *   Now let's check the matches again.\n                *   Horizontal 3-1: Window sill/panes match. (Yes)\n                *   Horizontal 4-2: Yellow chair/table match. (Yes: table in 4 is next to yellow chair in 2).\n                *   Vertical 3-4:\n                    *   3 (top-left) has the white pillar on its left.\n                    *   4 (bottom-left) has the blue chair on its left.\n                    *   Does the pillar in 3 align with the blue chair in 4?\n                    *   In 3, the blue chair is to the right of the pillar.\n                    *   In 4, the blue chair is on the left.\n                    *   YES! If 3 is above 4, the blue chair in 3 (right) would be above the blue chair in 4 (left)? No, that's still not right.\n                    *   WAIT! The blue chair in 3 is *below* the window. The blue chair in 4 is the *bottom* of a chair.\n                    *   If the blue chair in 3 is a *different* chair than the one in 4?\n                    *   No, look at the blue chair in 3. It's a whole chair! You can see the back and the seat.\n                    *   Look at the blue chair in 4. It's just the bottom part (seat and wheels).\n                    *   So 4 must be below a piece that has the top of *that* chair.\n                    *   The top of the chair in 4 is in... Part 3!\n                    *   Wait, let's look at Part 3 again. It has a blue chair.\n                    *   Where is it? It's in the bottom-right.\n                    *   So if 3 is above 4, the chair in 4 should be in the top-right.\n                    *   But in 4, the chair is in the top-left.\n                    *   This means 4 is NOT below 3.\n                    *   4 must be below whatever is to the right of 3.\n                    *   If 3 is top-left, then the piece to its right is top-right.\n                    *   So 4 must be below the top-right piece.\n                    *   If 3 is TL and 1 is TR, then 4 must be below 1.\n                    *   Let's check: 1 (top-right) has a patterned chair. 4 (bottom-right) has a solid blue chair. No.\n                    *   Let's try another way.\n                    *   What if 3 is Top-Right?\n                    *   Then the blue chair is in the bottom-right of the whole image.\n                    *   Then Part 4 (which has the bottom of the blue chair) would be... where?\n                    *   If 3 is TR, its bottom-right is the corner of the image.\n                    *   Then 4 could not be below it, because 4 has the chair in its top-left.\n                    *   Wait! If 3 is TR and 4 is BL?\n                    *   Then 3-bottom-left is the middle of the image.\n                    *   4-top-right is the middle of the image.\n                    *   If the chair is in the middle, it would be in 3-bottom-left and 4-top-right.\n                    *   Let's look: 3-bottom-left has... the pillar. 4-top-right has... the yellow chair. No.\n\n10. **Let's rethink everything. This should be simpler.**\n    *   Look at the options again. One of them *must* be right. Let's re-examine Option 1 one more time, very, very carefully.\n    *   Option 1: TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2.\n    *   Maybe my \"left/right\" assessments of the chairs within the pieces are slightly off.\n    *   Part 3: Pillar on left, window, then solid blue chair on the right.\n    *   Part 1: Window, plant, then patterned chair on the right.\n    *   Part 4: Solid blue chair on the left, table, yellow chair on the right.\n    *   Part 2: Yellow chair on the left, floor, patterned chair in background on the right.\n    *   Now let's see:\n        *   Horizontal 3-1: 3-right (window/blue chair) to 1-left (window). This matches!\n        *   Horizontal 4-2: 4-right (yellow chair) to 2-left (yellow chair). This matches!\n        *   Vertical 3-4: 3-bottom (pillar/window/blue chair) to 4-top (blue chair/table/yellow chair).\n            *   3-left (pillar) is above 4-left (blue chair).\n            *   3-right (blue chair) is above 4-right (yellow chair).\n            *   Wait, this doesn't seem to match.\n        *   Vertical 1-2: 1-bottom (window/plant/patterned chair) to 2-top (yellow chair/floor/patterned chair).\n            *   1-left (window/plant) is above 2-left (yellow chair).\n            *   1-right (patterned chair) is above 2-right (patterned chair background).\n            *   This actually works! The patterned chair is in the same horizontal position.\n\n11. **Let's try Option 1 again, but with a different vertical alignment.**\n    *   If TL=3, TR=1, BL=4, BR=2:\n    *   3 1\n    *   4 2\n    *   Let's look at the whole image this would form:\n        *   Top row: [Pillar][Window][Blue Chair Top] [Window][Plant][Patterned Chair]\n        *   Bottom row: [Blue Chair Bottom][Table][Yellow Chair Front] [Yellow Chair Back][Floor][Patterned Chair Background]\n    *   Does this make sense?\n        *   The solid blue chair (top in 3, bottom in 4) - wait, 3 is above 4, so they should be in the same column.\n        *   In 3, the blue chair is on the right. In 4, it's on the left.\n        *   Wait, they ARE in the same column! The blue chair is in the middle of the image, so it's on the right of the left piece (3) and the left of the right piece (1)? No.\n        *   Let's re-read: If 3 is TL and 1 is TR, the blue chair is on the right of 3. That means it's in the middle of the top row.\n        *   If 4 is BL and 2 is BR, the blue chair is on the left of 4. That means it's on the left of the bottom row.\n        *   This still doesn't align.\n\n12. **Let's try another option.**\n    *   Option 4: TL=2, TR=3, BL=1, BR=4.\n        *   2 3\n        *   1 4\n        *   Horizontal 2-3: 2-right (patterned chair) to 3-left (pillar). (No)\n        *   Vertical 2-1: 2-bottom (floor) to 1-top (window).
